# x_make_yahw_x — Control Room Lab Notes

> "Every empire starts with a single message. This one proves the tooling works before we escalate."

## Manifesto
x_make_yahw_x is the minimal hello-world harness I use to verify packaging, logging, and execution pathways. It may look simple, but it safeguards the Road to 0.20.4 pipeline by confirming the scaffolding behaves before we scale up.

## 0.20.4 Command Sequence
Version 0.20.4 keeps this harness parked at the front of the expanded Kanban. The greeting run now double-checks the unified exporter hooks and confirms `make_all_summary.json` records the Intake Reconnaissance column before heavier cooks begin.

## Ingredients
- Python 3.11+
- Ruff, Black, MyPy, and Pyright

## Cook Instructions
1. `python -m venv .venv`
2. `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
3. `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python -m x_make_yahw_x` to emit the greeting and validate the runtime path

## Quality Assurance
| Check | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Formatting sweep | `python -m black .`
| Lint interrogation | `python -m ruff check .`
| Type audit | `python -m mypy .`
| Static contract scan | `python -m pyright`
| Functional verification | `pytest`

## Cross-Linked Intelligence
- [x_make_common_x](../x_make_common_x/README.md) — demonstrates common logging and subprocess helpers in their simplest form
- [x_make_github_visitor_x](../x_make_github_visitor_x/README.md) — inspects this repo to confirm the compliance pipeline works under low heat
- [x_0_make_all_x](../x_0_make_all_x/README.md) — orchestrator uses this as a sanity check before heavier runs

## Lab Etiquette
Keep the sample tight. When you expand beyond "Hello world," capture the purpose and verification steps in the Change Control index so everyone knows why the baseline shifted.
