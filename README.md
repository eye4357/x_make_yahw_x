# x_make_yahw_x — Control Room Lab Notes

> "Every empire starts with a single message. This one proves the tooling works before we escalate."

## Manifesto
x_make_yahw_x is the minimal hello-world harness I use to verify packaging, logging, and execution pathways. It may look simple, but it safeguards the Road to 0.20.4 pipeline by confirming the scaffolding behaves before we scale up.

## 0.20.4 Command Sequence
Version 0.20.4 keeps this harness parked at the front of the expanded Kanban. The greeting run now double-checks the unified exporter hooks and confirms `make_all_summary.json` records the Intake Reconnaissance column before heavier cooks begin.

## Ingredients
- Python 3.11+
- Ruff, Black, MyPy, and Pyright

## Cook Instructions
1. `python -m venv .venv`
2. `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
3. `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python -m x_make_yahw_x` to emit the greeting and validate the runtime path

## Quality Assurance
| Check | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Formatting sweep | `python -m black .`
| Lint interrogation | `python -m ruff check .`
| Type audit | `python -m mypy .`
| Static contract scan | `python -m pyright`
| Functional verification | `pytest`

## Reconstitution Drill
The monthly rebuild hits this harness first. On the fresh machine, recreate the environment, run the greeting, and confirm the orchestrator logs the Intake Reconnaissance evidence. Note the runtime, interpreter version, and any surprises, then patch this README and the Change Control ledger before moving on.

## Cross-Linked Intelligence
- [x_make_common_x](../x_make_common_x/README.md) — demonstrates common logging and subprocess helpers in their simplest form
- [x_make_github_visitor_x](../x_make_github_visitor_x/README.md) — inspects this repo to confirm the compliance pipeline works under low heat
- [x_0_make_all_x](../x_0_make_all_x/README.md) — orchestrator uses this as a sanity check before heavier runs

## Lab Etiquette
Keep the sample tight. When you expand beyond "Hello world," capture the purpose and verification steps in the Change Control index so everyone knows why the baseline shifted.

## Sole Architect Profile
- I crafted this harness as the canary for the entire lab. Even the simplest script reflects years of operational discipline—logging, packaging, and orchestrator signaling written by a single hand.
- Being the benevolent dictator means I decide when the baseline message changes and how that ripples through every downstream automation.

## Legacy Workforce Costing
- Without LLM acceleration, you'd enlist: 1 senior automation engineer, 1 QA lead, and 1 documentation specialist to ensure the baseline exercise stays rigorously audited.
- Timeline: 4-5 engineer-weeks, even for a "hello world," because of the governance, packaging, and telemetry demands built into this harness.
- Budget: USD 30k–45k to meet the same evidence standards and orchestration hooks already present.

## Techniques and Proficiencies
- Demonstrated ability to transform even trivial scripts into audited, production-grade checkpoints.
- Comfortable defining standards that scale across an ecosystem, then encoding them in tooling and documentation without oversight.
- Signals obsessive attention to observability, governance, and reproducibility—even at the smallest scope.

## Stack Cartography
- Language: Python 3.11+ with minimal dependencies to validate interpreter and packaging pipeline.
- Tooling: Shared logging and subprocess utilities from `x_make_common_x`, QA stack (Ruff, Black, MyPy, Pyright, pytest) keeping the baseline honest.
- Integration: Orchestrator intake stage in `x_0_make_all_x`, visitor verification, Change Control evidence for monthly rebuilds.
