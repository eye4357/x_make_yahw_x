# x_make_yahw_x — Production Ledger

I document every change to this intake canary here. Entries follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and Semantic Versioning so even the smallest harness remains accountable.

## [0.20.4] - 2025-10-15
### Changed
- README updated for the Road to 0.20.4 release, documenting the Kanban intake checks and exporter smoke tests this harness now performs.
- Control notes refreshed to remind operators to capture greeting run evidence in `make_all_summary.json` before lighting heavier pipelines.

## [0.20.3] - 2025-10-14
### Changed
- README refreshed to note the Road to 0.20.3 audit capture baked into the harness runs.

## [0.20.2] - 2025-10-14
### Changed
- Updated the documentation to mark the Road to 0.20.2 checkpoint and reinforce the baseline verification role of this harness.

## [0.20.1] - 2025-10-13
### Changed
- Updated README references to the Road to 0.20.1 release hub and proposal so the hello-world harness mirrors the active milestone.

## [0.20.0-prep] - 2025-10-12
### Added
- Authored a control-room themed README and changelog to align the hello-world harness with the Road to 0.20.0 playbook.

### Changed
