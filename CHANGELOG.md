# x_make_yahw_x — Production Ledger

I document every change to this intake canary here. Entries follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and Semantic Versioning so even the smallest harness remains accountable.

### Changed
- README updated for the Road to 0.20.4 release, documenting the Kanban intake checks and exporter smoke tests this harness now performs.
- Control notes refreshed to remind operators to capture greeting run evidence in `make_all_summary.json` before lighting heavier pipelines.
