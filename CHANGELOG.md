# Changelog — Control Room Production Log

All notable changes to x_make_yahw_x are logged here. We respect [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and Semantic Versioning even for the smallest harness—consistency keeps the lab honest.

## [0.20.1] - 2025-10-13
### Changed
- Updated README references to the Road to 0.20.1 release hub and proposal so the hello-world harness mirrors the active milestone.

## [0.20.0-prep] - 2025-10-12
### Added
- Authored a control-room themed README and changelog to align the hello-world harness with the Road to 0.20.0 playbook.
- Linked the repo to orchestration, compliance, and change-control channels so it stays in the loop.

### Changed
- Clarified that future expansions must be justified and documented—this harness sets the tone for every other project.
